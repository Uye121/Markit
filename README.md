Our goal is to expand users’ online shopping habits into the real world, in the sense of connecting the virtual space within the real space. With the studio brief about environmental interaction, our app expands on this concept; we are exploring how people interact with the world when they are accustomed to the easiness and freedom of roaming in the online shopping space. We see the need from our users as they want to still get the best deal or best selection of a specific item with the same comparitibility that ecommerce giants like Amazon facilitate. So, no more Googling products to compare and contrast while shopping in the store. It doesn’t just save them time, it also gives them the alternative of online shopping and have a chance to be engaged in the real world. It also gives the stores their purpose of existence, which gives customers easier access to the products they need more readily.
